         <p>
            One day, the Prophet(PBUH) was talking with a group of Muslims and while they talked, the Messenger stopped talking and said to all those around him
	    that "Among you there is a man whose molar in Hell is greter than Mount Uhud." All of those men became frightened at once and was afraid that if the Prophet(PBUH) was 
	    talking about them, then they will have a dreadful end. Eventually many years went and all of those companions died as martyrs except two. Abu Hurairah and Ar-Rajjaal Ibn Unfuwah, 
	    who were still alive. Abu Hurairah was terrified the prophecy until fate revealed that it was Ar-Rajaal Ibn Unfuwah. Ar-Rajaal apostatized from Islam and went alongside of Musailamah the Liar,
	   and then saw the attainment of the prophecy on him. 
	
         <p>Ar-Rajjaal went to the prophet(PBUH) one day and he learned the teachings of Islam. He then did not return to Al-Madinah until the death of the Prophet and the choice of As-Saddiq as the Caliph of Muslims.
	    Ar-RAjjaal then went to Abu BAkr and told him about how the people of Al-Yamaamah supported Musailamah and so Ar-Rajjaal wanted to go to Al-Yamaamah so he could confirm Islam among them. Abu Bakr allowed it.
	    Ar-Rajjaal went to Al-Yamaamah and when he saw the many supporters of Musailamah, he thought they would be victorious. So he then apostatized from Islam and joined Musailamah. Ar-Rajjaal was more dangerous
	    to Islam than to Musailamah because he revealed his previous association with Islam and the period he had lived with the Messenger in Al-Madinah, memorizing many verses of the Holy Qur'aan, and his intercession
	    to Abu Bakr.
	
	 <p>Ar-Rajjaal told people that he heard the Messenger say that he had taken Musailamah into partnership and when the messenger died, he was worthry of carrying the banner of prophethood and revelation after him. 
	    Many of Musailamah's supporters increased because of the lies that Ar-Rajjaal told and when this news reached Al-Madiinah, the muslims became irate because of the lies Ar-Rajjaal told. These lies fueled the war and
	   worsened conflict for the muslims and their enmeies. The most eager to meet Ar-Rajjaal was Zaid Ibn Al-Khattab. His faith in Allah, His Messenger and his religion was strong and firm, and in every battle he sought martyrdom 
	   more than he sought victory.
