            <h1>Zaid Ibn Al-Khattab</h1>
         </header>

        
         <p>In Zaid's opinion, Ar-Rajjaal was not only an apostate, but also a hypocrite and selfish. Zaid, like his brother Umar, was disgusted of the 
	    hypocrisy and lies, especially when the hypocrisy was toward selfish gain and mean purposes. For those mean purposes, Ar-Rajjaal commited his 
	    atrocious acts, which resulted in supporters for Musailamah and causing a vast number of deaths in the Apostate Battle.  
         
	 <p>Zaid prepared himself to conclude his faithful life by annihilating the impiety in Musailamah's person and Ar-Rajjaal, who became more dangerous and cunning.
	    The Day of Al-Yamaamah began gloomy and dim.Khaalid Ibn Al-Waliid gathered the Army of Islam and gave the lead position to Zaid Ibn Al-Khattab. In the start
	    of the battle many of the Muslims fell as martyrs because of the difference in supporters of the sides. Zaid saw the horror in some of the muslims hearts. So
	    he climbed a hill abd said"O people! Grit your teeth, fight your enemy, and go straight. By Allah, I'll never speak till Allah beats them or I meet Him and then I give my
	    evidence" Then he descended, gritting his teeth, pressing his lips, never moving his tongue with even a whisper.
		
	 <p>His only mission was to kill Ar-Rajjaal, so he began to seek him. He went through the enemy army with ease, until he found Ar-Rajjaal. Then he began to attack left and right,
	    but everytime thd battle swallowed up Ar-Rajjaal, but Zaid was determined to kill him. Eventually Zaid got a grasp of Ar-Rajaal's neck and with his sword, he cut his head off
	    which was full of lies and villainy. Once Ar-Rajaal was dead Musailamah's army started to crumble. Musailamah promised an inevitable victory and that he, Ar-Rajaal, and Al-Makham Ibn Attufail
	    would promote their new religion and establish their state on the day following their victory. However, now that Ar-Rajaal was killed, the prophecy of Musailamah was seen as a lie.
