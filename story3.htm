            <h1>Zaid Ibn Al-Khattab</h1>
         </header>

        
         <p>Once the muslims heard the news of Ar-Rajaal's Death they were filled with pride and dignity. Zaid raised his hands towards Heaven
	    supplicating Allah and thanking him for his blessings. Then he returned to his sword and his silence, as he had sworn by Allah not
	    to say a single word until he was victorious or gained the honor of martyrdom. The Muslims began to take the winning side in the battle
	    and in that moment Zaid didn not desire a better end to his life than praying to Allah to grant him martyrdom on that Day of Al-Yamaamah!
	    His prayer was granted and he died as a martyr, gracefully and happily. After, the battle the Army of Islam returned to Al-Madina as the victors.  

	 <p>While Umar and the Caliph were welcoming those who were returning triumphantly, Umar was searching for his big brother. Zaid was so tall that he could
	    be easily seen. But, before Umar strained his eyes a returning Muslim approached him and consoled him. Umar said"May Allah have mercy upon Zaid, he preceded
	    me in two instances. He embraced Islam before me and gained martyrdom before me, too" Despite the victories that Islam had won and enjoyed Umar never forgot
	    about his brother Zaid, and he always said "When ever the east wind blows, I smell the scent of Zaid".
		
	 <p>Yes! The east wind does carry the scent of Zaid. But if the caliph gives me permission to add these words to his great expression so as to complete the meaning
	    of his saying, these are the words."Whenever the winds of triumph blow on Islam since the Day of Al-Yamaamah, Islam finds the scent, the struggles, the heroism,
	    and the greatness of Zaid in these winds."
