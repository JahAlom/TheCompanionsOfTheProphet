# TheCompanionsOfTheProphet
This project was one of the first projects I ever made in Freshman year of HS, in 2014.

I designed this small project in 2014 back when I was beginning to learn how to code for a small muslim organization and made a small presentation out of it, instead of doing a slideshow, I decided to make a website.
